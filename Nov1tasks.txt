#Difference between Interpreter and Compiler
 
       INTERPRETER                                                                        COMPILER


1. Interpreter translates just one statement                          1. Compiler scans the entire program and translates             
of the program at a time into machine code.	                         the whole of it into machine code at once.

2. An interpreter takes very less time                                2. A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. 
to analyze the source code. However,                                     However, the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.
the overall time to execute the                              
 process is much slower.	 
                                             	 
3. An interpreter does not generate                                   3. A compiler always generates an intermediary object code.
an intermediary code.  Hence, an                                         It will need further linking. Hence more memory is needed.
interpreter is highly efficient                  
in terms of its memory.	

4. Keeps translating the program continuously till                    4. A compiler generates the error message only after it scans 
 the first error is confronted. If any error                             the complete program and hence debugging is
   is spotted,it stops working                                           relatively harder while working with a compiler. 
and hence debugging becomes easy.
                               
5. Interpreters are used by programming                               5. Compliers are used by programming languages like C and C++ for example.
languages like Ruby and Python for example.

#Difference between python 2 and python 3



Basis of comparison	                                    Python 3	                             Python 2

Release Date	                                              2008	                               2000

Function print	                                          print (“hello”)	                    print “hello”

Division of Integers	                      Whenever two integers are divided,            	When two integers are divided, 
                                                   you get a float value                               you always provide integer value.

Unicode	                                    In Python 3, default storing of 	                To store Unicode string value,

Syntax                                         The syntax is simpler and                      The syntax of Python 2 was comparatively 
                                                easily understandable.	                                difficult to understand

Exceptions	                          It should be enclosed in parenthesis.	                It should be enclosed in notations.


Leak of variables	                  The value of variables never changes.	                The value of the global variable will

Backward compatibility	                  Not difficult to port python 2 to                      Python version 3 is not backwardly
