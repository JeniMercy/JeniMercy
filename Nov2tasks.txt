TASK1:
 
What's end/sep parameter in print function


The end parameter:

The end parameter is used to append any string at the end of the output of the print statement in python.

By default, the print method ends with a newline. 

This means there is no need to explicitly specify the parameter end as '\n'. 
 
EX1:
print("Studytonight",)
print("is awesome")

print("Studytonight", end= "\n")
print("is awesome")

Output: Studytonight
        is awesome
        Studytonight
        is awesome
EX2:
print("Studytonight", end=' ')
print("is awesome")

Output: Studytonight is awesome


EX3:
print("Hi", end=' Studytonight ')
print("you are awesome")

Output: Hi Studytonight you are awesome


The sep parameter:
 
             Sometimes, we may wish to print multiple values in a Python program in a readable manner. 
This is when the argument sep is used. 
The arguments passed to the program can be separated by different values.
The default value for sep is whitespace.
The sep parameter is primarily used to format the strings.

EX1:
print("Study", "tonight")
print("Study", "tonight", sep = ' ')

Output:

Study tonight
Study tonight

EX2:
print("Study", "tonight", sep = '')
print("Study", "tonight", sep = ' & ')

Output:

Studytonight
Study & tonight

EX3:
print("Studytonight","has","been","created","for", sep = " _ ", end=" _STUDENTS")

Output:

Studytonight _ has _ been _ created _ for _STUDENTS
