Advantages of tuples:

*Tuples are fined size in nature 
*i.e. we can't add/delete elements to/from a tuple.
*We can search any element in a tuple.
*Tuples are faster than lists, because they have a constant set of values.
*Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, because they contain immutable values like strings, numbers, etc.
*Tuples are used whenever you want to return multiple results from a function. 
*Since they're immutable, they can be used as keys for a dictionary (lists can't).


Advantages of Sets:

*Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. 
*Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
*Sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, 
it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and 
to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.
